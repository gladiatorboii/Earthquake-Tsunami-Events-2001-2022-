# Earthquake-Tsunami-Events-2001-2022-

# Insights and Observations:
1. Time-Based Analysis
  . Yearly fluctuations with peaks in active years (2004, 2011).

  . No steady rise; global seismic activity is irregular but impactful.

2. Magnitude & Depth
  . Tsunami quakes: high magnitude (≥6.5) and shallow (≤50 km).
  
  . Most ≥8.0 events cause tsunamis.

  . Shallow boundary quakes pose highest risk.

3. Geographic Distribution
  . Tsunami events cluster along subduction zones (Pacific Ring of Fire).

  . Non-tsunami quakes are globally spread.

  . High-density zones near ocean trenches.

4. Statistical Insights
  . Tsunami events → higher magnitudes, fewer in number.
 
 Correlations:
  . Tsunami quakes have higher magnitudes but are less frequent.

  . Greater magnitude increases, and deeper focus decreases tsunami likelihood.
